library
=======

Here I have two things:
* The `CubeFile` library: Here is a C++ class which reads and manipulates Gaussian `cube` file format. The class itself
is not very fancy, but I have wrapped it using [Boost.Python](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc)
to give the user a powerful command line option to manipulate cube files.

* The `bpy` library
Something
