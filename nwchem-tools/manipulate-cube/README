Manipulate cube files!

This program can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and exponentiate cube files with another cube file or a scalar
It can also integrate and take the absolute value of cube files.

You will need to have f2py and python installed!
Use the compile.sh script to compile subroutines for python program

Examples of usage:
manipulate-cube.py orbital1.cube orbital2.cube -add

manipulate-cube.py orbital1.cube orbital1.cube -mul

manipulate-cube.py orbital1.cube 10 -mul

manipulate-cube.py orbital1.cube -int

manipulate-cube.py orbital1.cube -abs

Some cautionary notes:
1) If you put the operation before the cubefiles, or in between, this will not work. Argparse can be finicky!
2) If you try to divide by zero, the program will ignore it and place a 0.0 in the output cube file.
