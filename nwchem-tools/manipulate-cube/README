Manipulate cube files!

This program can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and exponentiate cube files with another cube file or a scalar
It can also integrate and take the absolute value of cube files.

Use the compile.sh script to compile program (requires gfortran, change compiler to suit needs)

Examples of usage:
manipulate-cube orbital1.cube orbital2.cube -add

manipulate-cube orbital1.cube --mul orbital1.cube

manipulate-cube -subtract orbital1.cube orbital1.cube

manipulate-cube orbital1.cube --multiply 10

manipulate-cube -int orbital1.cube

manipulate-cube -abs orbital1.cube

Some cautionary notes:
1) Dividing two cubefiles is a dangerous operation. If you try to divide by zero it will skip the operation and set the point to zero.
2) Running the following:
    manipulate-cube -int orbital1.cube orbital2.cube
This will only integrate the first cube file on the command line! The second is completely ignored.
