fon-gen
=======

Here is the `fon-gen` utility. Honestly, this script was made early in my
PhD career and is poorly written. I need to re-write this script using
my modern `simpletemplate.py`, `docopt`, and better python syntax to
increase readability and usability.

The point of the script was to automate computations on a large computer
cluster to calculate fractional occupation numbers in Density Functional
Theory. If you are interested in the script please email me.
