Scripts
===

This repository contains many of the scripts I use for my research projects. I will shortly explain
what is available here, and README files will be available for detailed usage instructions. Everything
here is maintained by myself (Barry Moore) and is distributed freely without any
warranty.

* library: This directory currently contains a cube file manipulation tool to be used with python, mainly.
* misc: This directory contains some tools for SLURM, LaTeX, and some generic research tools I have built.
* nwchem-tools: As most of my research is completed with NWChem this directory contains the most scripts.
The majority of my PhD research is focused on functional tuning. See directory README for details.
* spec-gen: This directory contains a spectral generator I am currently working on.
